Decoder and tooling for the RDWorks `.rd` file format

## About

[Thunderlaser](http://www.thunderlaser.com) laser cutter need a proprietary Windows
software ([RDWorks](http://rdworks.software.informer.com/8.0)) to
operate.

RDWorks generates `.rd` files to communicate with the laser cutter.

`.rd` files are (trivially) scrambled with strange encodings for
integer and floating point values.

This project provides tooling to display and decode this file format.
